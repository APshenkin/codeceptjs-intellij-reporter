[Codeceptjs](https://codecept.io/) intermediary test reporter for enabling Codeceptjs support inside WebStorm and other IntelliJ IDEs with NodeJS support

It was forked from the [mocha-intellij](https://github.com/JetBrains/mocha-intellij) reporter and [cypress-intellij-reporter](https://github.com/mbolotov/cypress-intellij-reporter)

This one is used for [intellij-codeceptjs plugin](https://github.com/APshenkin/intellij-codeceptjs)
